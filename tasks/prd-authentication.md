# Product Requirements Document: Authentication & Onboarding System

## Introduction/Overview

This feature introduces a comprehensive authentication system using Clerk for user sign-up and sign-in, coupled with a multi-step onboarding flow for new users. The system will replace any existing authentication mechanism and ensure seamless integration with the current Supabase database structure while maintaining the app's fitness-focused user experience.

**Problem Statement:** The app currently lacks a proper authentication system, preventing user data persistence, personalization, and secure access to fitness tracking features.

**Goal:** Implement a secure, user-friendly authentication system that guides new users through profile setup while maintaining existing users' workflow continuity.

## Goals

1. **Secure Authentication:** Implement industry-standard authentication using Clerk
2. **Seamless Onboarding:** Guide new users through essential profile setup in a multi-step wizard
3. **Database Integration:** Sync user data between Clerk and existing Supabase schema
4. **Brand Consistency:** Maintain app's visual identity throughout authentication flows
5. **User Retention:** Minimize friction in sign-up/sign-in processes
6. **Data Integrity:** Ensure robust error handling and data persistence

## User Stories

**As a new user:**
- I want to sign up quickly and securely so I can start tracking my fitness
- I want to complete my profile setup in manageable steps so I don't feel overwhelmed
- I want the sign-up process to match the app's design so it feels cohesive
- I want to resume onboarding if I accidentally close the app

**As a returning user:**
- I want to sign in quickly and access my existing data
- I want my profile information to be preserved and accessible
- I want to log out securely when needed

**As a user who encounters issues:**
- I want clear error messages when authentication fails
- I want the app to retry automatically when network issues occur
- I want to recover gracefully from interrupted processes

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication Core
1. The system must integrate Clerk SDK for React Native/Expo applications
2. The system must display authentication screens on app startup for unauthenticated users
3. The system must support email/password sign-up and sign-in flows
4. The system must handle Clerk authentication state changes and update app navigation accordingly
5. The system must store Clerk user ID as reference in Supabase profiles table

### Sign-Up Flow
6. The system must present a sign-up form with email and password fields
7. The system must validate email format and password strength before submission
8. The system must redirect successful sign-ups to the onboarding flow
9. The system must create a corresponding profile record in Supabase upon successful Clerk registration

### Onboarding Flow (Multi-Step Wizard)
10. The system must present onboarding as a multi-step wizard with progress indication
11. **Step 1:** The system must collect basic information (name, age, sex)
12. **Step 2:** The system must collect physical measurements (height, weight)
13. **Step 3:** The system must collect activity level selection
14. **Step 4:** The system must collect unit preferences (metric/imperial)
15. The system must allow users to navigate back to previous steps
16. The system must validate required fields before allowing step progression
17. The system must save onboarding progress and allow resumption if app is closed
18. The system must sync all collected data to Supabase profiles table upon completion

### Sign-In Flow
19. The system must present a sign-in form with email and password fields
20. The system must authenticate users through Clerk and redirect to main app upon success
21. The system must load existing user profile data from Supabase after successful sign-in

### Database Integration
22. The system must create/update Supabase profiles record with Clerk user ID as primary key
23. The system must sync user profile data between Clerk and Supabase
24. The system must maintain existing RLS policies for authenticated users
25. The system must handle database connection errors gracefully

### Logout Functionality
26. The system must provide logout option in the profile/settings page
27. The system must clear Clerk session and redirect to authentication screen upon logout
28. The system must clear any cached user data from local storage

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
29. The system must display user-friendly error messages for authentication failures
30. The system must implement automatic retry mechanism for network-related failures
31. The system must handle interrupted onboarding by saving progress and allowing resumption
32. The system must validate all user inputs with appropriate error messaging
33. The system must handle Clerk service unavailability gracefully

### UI/UX Requirements
34. The system must apply the app's full design system (colors, fonts, spacing, components)
35. The system must create custom Clerk theme matching app branding
36. The system must ensure responsive design across different screen sizes
37. The system must provide loading states for all async operations
38. The system must include proper accessibility features (screen reader support, focus management)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Social media authentication (Google, Apple, Facebook) - Phase 2
- Two-factor authentication - Phase 2
- Password reset functionality (handled by Clerk)
- User profile editing (existing functionality)
- Advanced onboarding customization based on user type
- Integration with fitness device APIs during onboarding
- Email verification customization (handled by Clerk)

## Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Color Scheme:** Use existing app colors defined in `constants/colors.ts`
- **Typography:** Match existing font families and sizes
- **Components:** Leverage existing UI components from `app/components/`
- **Branding:** Include app logo and maintain visual consistency

### User Experience
- **Progress Indicators:** Clear step progression in onboarding wizard
- **Navigation:** Intuitive back/next buttons with proper validation
- **Loading States:** Skeleton screens and loading indicators
- **Error States:** Clear, actionable error messages

### Responsive Design
- Support for various screen sizes and orientations
- Proper keyboard handling for form inputs
- Touch-friendly button sizes and spacing

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- **Clerk SDK:** `@clerk/clerk-expo` for React Native/Expo authentication
- **Navigation:** Integration with existing React Navigation setup
- **State Management:** Integration with existing store structure
- **Database:** Maintain existing Supabase client configuration

### Database Schema Updates
- No schema changes required - existing `profiles` table supports all needed fields
- Clerk user ID will map to existing `id` field (UUID) in profiles table
- Existing RLS policies will work with Clerk authentication

### Integration Points
- **Supabase Client:** Update `lib/supabaseClient.ts` to work with Clerk session tokens
- **Navigation:** Modify app navigation to include authentication screens
- **Store:** Update user state management to work with Clerk user data

### Performance Considerations
- Implement proper loading states to handle authentication delays
- Cache user profile data appropriately
- Optimize onboarding flow to minimize API calls

### Security
- Leverage Clerk's built-in security features
- Maintain existing RLS policies in Supabase
- Ensure secure token handling between Clerk and Supabase

## Open Questions

1. **Clerk Plan:** Which Clerk pricing plan will be used? (affects feature availability)
2. **Avatar Upload:** Should profile picture upload be included in onboarding or deferred?
3. **Data Migration:** Are there existing users whose data needs to be migrated?
4. **Offline Handling:** How should the app behave when authentication is required but device is offline?
5. **Session Management:** What should be the session timeout duration?
6. **Onboarding Skip:** Should users be allowed to skip onboarding steps, or are all required?
7. **Profile Validation:** Should there be validation for realistic height/weight values?
8. **Activity Level:** Should activity level include custom options or only predefined choices?
